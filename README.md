# Securing-IoT-Devices-Utilizing-Machine-Learning-Approach
A research project on Securing IoT Device Using Machine Learning
It allows the emphasis on how Machine Learning can provide better secuirty for devices. As technology advances those devices and its data become more vulnerable. There are 8 methods, that I research to help pontentially secure the IoT devices and its data. Those 8 methods are, Strong Password Use, Two Factor Authntication , Blockchain Technology etc.
